\# Non-Electrical Signal Diagnosis



This project focuses on analyzing non-electrical physiological signals to predict or classify health conditions using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The analysis and models are implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook.



\## 🎯 Project Objective

\- Analyze non-electrical biomedical signals

\- Extract meaningful features (time-domain, frequency-domain, statistical)

\- Apply machine learning (SVM, Random Forest, KNN) and deep learning models (CNN, LSTM)

\- Perform classification and regression to predict diagnostic outcomes



\## 🧠 Methods and Techniques

\- \*\*Signal Preprocessing:\*\* Noise filtering, normalization

\- \*\*Feature Extraction:\*\* Statistical, spectral, and domain-specific features

\- \*\*Model Development:\*\* Machine learning and deep learning models

\- \*\*Evaluation:\*\* Accuracy, F1-score, Mean Squared Error, R² depending on the task
